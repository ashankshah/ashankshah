# Hi, I’m Ashank 👋

I’m a student at the **California Institute of Technology**, majoring in **Computer Science** and broadly interested in **Machine Learning, Biology, and Mathematics**.  
Currently, I’m an **Agentic AI Engineer at Preface Health (Techstars ’25)**, where I work on building intelligent automation for healthcare systems.

## 🧠 Work

### **Agentic AI System for EMR Automation — Preface Health**
Developed a **pure-Python Agentic AI system** that updates and validates patient charts within EMR platforms using **LLM-driven reasoning** and **RPA automation**.  
- Built dynamic UI control pipelines with `pywinauto`, `pyautogui`, and `OpenAI APIs`, enabling autonomous navigation and interaction with complex EMR interfaces.

### **AI Marketing Collateral Generator — Avestor**
Created and deployed an **AI-powered marketing content generator** for fund managers, automating the creation of compliant emails, investment summaries, and one-pagers.  
- Implemented a **structured output Agentic GPT workflow** using **Python** and **FastAPI**.

## 🧩 Personal Projects

### **Mockly** — React · Python · FastAPI · OpenCV · TensorFlow · Hugging Face · PostgreSQL  
Launched a full-stack web app with **50+ beta testers** providing realistic mock interview practice.  
- Integrated a **fine-tuned Mistral-7B LLM** and three **computer vision models** to deliver detailed feedback on both **verbal** and **non-verbal** performance.

### **PhytoBot** — TensorFlow · Data Augmentation · CNNs · IoT · Arduino · Raspberry Pi  
Developed a **provisionally patented** IoT-powered robotic platform integrating a **dual deep learning pipeline (Faster R-CNN + CNN)** for early detection of **potato late blight** with **99.8% accuracy**.  
- Collaborated with a local farmer to design a **scalable, cost-effective** system enabling real-time disease identification across large agricultural fields.

### **Blend** — SwiftUI · Figma · Algorithmic Color Matching  
Built an iOS app that computes the **optimal pencil blend** to match any pixel in a reference image, tailored to an artist’s available set.  
- Designed the UI/UX in **Figma** and implemented a **custom color-matching algorithm** in **SwiftUI**.

## 🔬 Research

### **Deep Learning for Single-Cell Xenium Inference**
Designed six deep learning pipelines (CNN, ResNet50 transfer learning, Autoencoder-Embedded GCN) for inferring single-cell gene expression from H&E histology images.  
- Leveraged **PyTorch**, **Scanpy**, and **HPC workflows** to explore the feasibility of **histology-to-transcriptomics translation**.

### **Generative AI for Data Augmentation in Cancer Diagnosis**
Built and trained **Conditional GAN** and **Diffusion Probabilistic Models** to augment scarce malignant histopathology data in **squamous cell carcinoma**.  
- The generative augmentation **significantly improved classifier accuracy**, demonstrating potential for more reliable early cancer detection.

### **Multimodal Deep Learning for de novo Drug Design**
Developed a **multimodal generative pipeline** in **PyTorch** that combines autoencoders with a **binding-affinity-guided loss function** to design novel drug candidates.  
- Trained large-scale **protein–molecule models** on **HPC clusters**, accelerating computational drug discovery.
